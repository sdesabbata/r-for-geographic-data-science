# Welcome {.unnumbered}

<img src="images/r-for-geographic-data-science-cover.png" class="cover" width="250" height="328"/>This book is an introduction to geographic data science using `R` [@R-base], which I designed as a companion for the module [GY7702 R for Data Science](https://le.ac.uk/modules/2023/gy7702) of the [MSc in Geographic Information Science](https://le.ac.uk/courses/geographical-information-science-msc/2023) at the [School of Geography, Geology, and the Environment](https://le.ac.uk/gge) of the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/). As such, it is very much *a work in progress* and currently under revision for the *2023/24* module.

## Aims and learning objectives {.unnumbered}

The materials included in this book have been designed for a module focusing on the programming language R as an effective tool for data science for geographers. R is one of the most widely used programming languages. It provides access to a vast repository of programming libraries, covering all aspects of data science, from data wrangling to statistical analysis, from machine learning to data visualisation. That includes various libraries for processing spatial data, performing geographic information analysis, and creating maps. As such, R is a highly versatile, free and open-source tool in geographic information science, which combines the capabilities of traditional GIS software with the advantages of a scripting language and an interface to a vast array of algorithms.

The materials aim to cover the necessary skills in basic programming, data wrangling and reproducible research to tackle sophisticated but non-spatial data analyses. The first part of the module will focus on core programming techniques, data wrangling and practices for reproducible research. The second part of the module will focus on non-spatial data analysis approaches, including statistical analysis and machine learning.

The book and lecture slides use `#FFF0E2` as the background colour to avoid using a pure white background, which can make reading more difficult and slower for people with dyslexia. All colours have also been checked for readability using [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/).

## About me {.unnumbered}

Hi there, my name is Stef. I am a [Associate Professor of Geographical Information Science](http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geography/people/stefano-de-sabbata) at the [School of Geography, Geology and the Environment](http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geography) and research theme lead for [Cultural Informatics](https://le.ac.uk/research/institutes/digital-culture/areas) at the [Institute for Digital Culture](https://le.ac.uk/research/institutes/digital-culture) of the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/), and a [Research Associate](http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/desabbata/) of the [Oxford Internet Institute](http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) of the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/).

I am a geographic data scientist working at the intersection between human geography, artificial intelligence and internet studies. Most of my research focuses on three intertwined research streams: the development of machine learning approaches to geographic data analysis, the study of the geographies of content created through internet platforms, and the application of both to quantitative urban geography. I teach data science and programming in R, information visualisation, geospatial databases and information retrieval, digital geographies and geographic information science. I am the Chair of the [Geographic Information Science Research Group](https://geoinfo.science/) of the [Royal Geographical Society with IBG](https://www.rgs.org/). I am also part of the steering committee of [GIScience Research UK (GISRUK)](http://gisruk.org/), and I was the chair of the [GISRUK 2018 conference](http://leicester.gisruk.org/). I am a member of the [Commission on Location-Based Services](http://lbs.icaci.org/) of the International Cartographic Association.

Earlier in my career, I worked as a Researcher at the [Oxford Internet Institute](http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) of the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) (2013-2015), and I was Junior Research Fellow at the [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/) of the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) (2014-2015). I was awarded a PhD from the [Department of Geography](http://www.geo.uzh.ch/) of the [University of Zurich](http://www.uzh.ch/en.html) in 2013 and a BSc and an MSc in computer science from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the [University of Udine](http://www.uniud.it/it).

## Reproducibility {.unnumbered}

### Instructor {.unnumbered}

You can now reproduce R for Geographic Data Science using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). First, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system, [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if not already installed, and [clone this repository from GitHub](https://github.com/sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science). You can then either build the `sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science` image running the `Docker_Build.sh` script from the `src` folder of the [repository](https://github.com/sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science) or [pull the latest sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science image from the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science).

You should now have all the code and the computational environment to reproduce these materials, which can be done by running the script `src/Docker_Make.sh` (`src/Docker_Make_WinPowerShell.sh` on Windows using PowerShell). The script will instantiate a Docker container for the `sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science` image, bind mount the repository folder to the container and execute `src/Make.R` on the container, clearing and re-making all the materials. The data used in the materials can be re-created from the original open data using the scripts in `src/utils`, as described in `data/README.md`.

For instance, in a Unix-based system like Linux or Mac OS, you can reproduce R for Geographic Data Science using the following four commands:


```bash
docker pull sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science:latest
git clone https://github.com/sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science.git
cd r-for-geographic-data-science

# follow the instructions in data/README.md before continuing

./src/Docker_Make.sh
```

This approach should allow not simply to use the materials but to easily edit and create your version in the same computational environment. To develop your materials, modify the code in the repository and run the `src/Docker_Make.sh` from the repository folder again to obtain the updated materials.

The [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) [@R-rmarkdown] code used to create the materials for this book and the lecture slides can be found in the `src/book` and `src/slides` folders, respectively. The files are used to generate the [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) [@R-bookdown] book and [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) slides. The `src/slides` folder contains the `xaringan` templates and styles used in the RMarkdown code.


```bash
.
âââ data
âââ docs
    âââ slides
âââ src
    âââ book
    âââ images
    âââ practicals
    âââ slides
    âââ utils
```

You can edit the materials in the `r-for-geographic-data-science` repository folder using RStudio or another editor on your computer and then compile the new materials using Docker. Alternatively, you can follow the *learner* instructions below to start RStudio Server using Docker and develop your materials in the same environment in which they will be compiled.The first option might be quicker for minor edits, whereas the latter might be preferable for substantial modifications, especially when you need to test your code.

### Learner {.unnumbered}

As a learner, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to follow the practical sessions instructions and complete the exercises. First, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system, [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if not already installed, and [clone this repository from GitHub](https://github.com/sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science).

You can then either build the `sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science` image running the `Docker_Build.sh` script from the `src` folder of the [repository](https://github.com/sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science) or [pull the latest sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science image from the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science). You should now have all the code and the computational environment to reproduce these materials, which can be done by running the script `src/Docker_RStudio_Start.sh` (`src/Docker_RStudio_Start_WinPowerShell.sh` on Windows using PowerShell) from the repository folder.

For instance, in a Unix-based system like Linux or Mac OS, you can set up and start the r-for-geographic-data-science container using the following four commands:


```bash
docker pull sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science:latest
git clone https://github.com/sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science.git
cd r-for-geographic-data-science

# follow the instructions in data/README.md before continuing

./src/Docker_RStudio_Start.sh
```

The `src/Docker_RStudio_Start.sh` script will first create a `my_r-for-geographic-data-science` folder in the parent directory of the root directory of the repository (if it doesn't exist). The script will then instantiate a Docker container for the `sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science` image, bind mount the `my_r-for-geographic-data-science` folder and the `r-for-geographic-data-science` repository folder to the container and start an RStudio Server.

The script outpur will include a line starting with `The password is set to` followed by a temporary password that you will need to access the RStudio Server. Copy the temporary password. Using your browser, you can access the RStudio Server running from the Docker container by typing `127.0.0.1:28787` in your address bar and using `rstudio` as username and the temporary password copied above as password. As the `my_r-for-geographic-data-science` folder is bound, everything you will save in the `my_r-for-geographic-data-science` folder in your home directory on RStudio Server will be saved on your computer. Everything else will be lost when the Docker container is stopped.

To stop the Docker container, running the script `src/Docker_RStudio_Stop.sh` (same on Windows using PowerShell) from the repository folder.
